# Subscriptions site

This is a NextJS 15 project that is currently a landing page where users can sign up (via external form) for the FASTNEAR free tier. There's also an external page linking to a Stripe landing page for a recurring subscription.

Some plan details are defined here:

    src/app/pricing/_logic/plan-types.ts

Single-sign on and API keys and auth is all part of this, but there will be an initial push of interest during November that this site is meant to capture.

## Do it

    yarn
    yarn dev

## Contribution guide

Don't add any extra fancy stuff. Well okay every once in a while, but be mindful.
